## Software Engineer | Active Learner | Tech Enthusiast

Currently based in Dallas, Texas, I am a Software Engineer at Phoenix Innovations LLC. With a strong foundation in Python as my main tech stack, I specialize in creating innovative solutions and delivering impactful projects.

Previously, I lived in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where I completed my studies at Cégep de la Gaspésie et des Îles Montreal Campus and worked as a Software Engineer for 1.5 years. Now, I am pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the University of the Cumberlands to deepen my technical expertise and broaden my knowledge in advanced computing.

Driven by curiosity, I love exploring new places and learning cutting-edge technologies. My passion lies in blending creativity and technical skills to craft efficient, user-focused software solutions.
